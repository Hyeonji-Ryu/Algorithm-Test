# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
# You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

# Example 1:
# Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
# Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

# Example 2:
# Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
# Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]




# plan 1

s.reverse()



# plan 2

copy = s[:]
for i in range(2, len(s)+1):
    
    s.append(copy[-i])
del s[0:len(copy)-1]
